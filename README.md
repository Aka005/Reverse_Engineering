# Reverse_Engineering

🔁 Upgrade #2: Reverse Engineering → Exploitation Thinking
Add one reflection:
How this logic could be bypassed
What a secure implementation would look like
How attackers commonly abuse similar patterns in real malware
New interview framing:
“After reversing the password logic, I evaluated how easily the protection could be bypassed and what secure coding practices would prevent it.”
That turns it from academic → practical.
